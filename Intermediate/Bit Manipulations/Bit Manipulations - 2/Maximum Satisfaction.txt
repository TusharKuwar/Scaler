Problem Description
Given an array of integers A of size N denoting the quality of the fruits. A[i] represents the fruit quality of the ith fruit.

Shaun needs to pick four fruits, but he needs to pick them so that his satisfaction value will be maximum.

If a, b, c, and d are fruit quality of the four fruits picked, then the satisfaction value(a, b, c, d) = (a & b & c & d) where & is bitwise AND operator.

Find the maximum satisfaction value Shaun can obtain.



Problem Constraints
4 <= N <= 105

1 <= A[i] <= 2 * 109



Input Format
The only argument given is the integer array A.



Output Format
Return the maximum satisfaction value Shaun can obtain.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = [10, 20, 15, 4, 14]
Input 2:

 A = [2, 2, 7, 15]


Example Output
Output 1:

 4
Output 2:

 2


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 Shaun can pick fruits with fruits quality 20, 15, 4, 14 and satisfaction value is (20 & 15 & 4 & 15) = 4 
Explanation 2:

 Shaun will pick fruits with fruits quality 2, 2, 7, 15 and satisfaction value is(2 & 2 & 7 & 15) = 2
